# Mood Taxonomy (V2)
## Goal: fast, consistent mood logging with minimal cognitive load

V2 mood capture is designed to be:
- **tap-based**
- **consistent across days**
- expressive enough for pattern detection
- not clinical, not diagnostic

---

## 1. Core Mood Dimensions (Required)

### 1.1 Valence (How it feels)
Pick one:
- **Positive**
- **Neutral**
- **Negative**

### 1.2 Energy (How activated you feel)
Pick one:
- **High**
- **OK**
- **Low**

### 1.3 Stress (Pressure level)
Pick one:
- **Low**
- **Medium**
- **High**

These three dimensions enable strong patterns like:
- negative + high stress → snack within 60 min
- low energy mornings → late afternoon cravings

---

## 2. Optional Single-Tag (Choose up to 1)
This is a lightweight label to explain *why* mood is negative/positive.

Pick one (or none):
- **Anxious**
- **Bored**
- **Sad**
- **Angry**
- **Lonely**
- **Celebratory**
- **Tired** *(optional — only include if users want it)*

Rule: only allow **one tag** to avoid overthinking and inconsistency.

---

## 3. Optional Confidence Toggle
Sometimes the user is unsure; capturing this helps interpret noise.

- **Sure**
- **Unsure**

---

## 4. UI Logging Recommendation (Fast Path)
A “mood check-in” should be possible in **3 taps**:
1) valence
2) energy
3) stress
(optional) tag

Target time: **≤ 10 seconds**.

---

## 5. Notes on Language / Safety
- Avoid clinical terms like “depressed,” “panic,” “diagnosis.”
- Frame outputs as **personal patterns**:
  - “Your logs suggest…” not “This indicates…”

---

## 6. Example Mood Entries
1) Negative / OK / High + Anxious  
2) Neutral / Low / Medium  
3) Positive / High / Low + Celebratory
